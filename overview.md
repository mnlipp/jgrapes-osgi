Additional components for the JGrapes framework that support or require
an OSGi framework as runtime environment.

Package {@link org.jgrapes.osgi.core} provides support for easily
integrating the JGrapes component model and OSGi services.

The remaining packages provide conlets for use in a JGrapes Web Console
that depend on an OSGi framework and are therefore not part of the
base web console project.
