JGrapes OSGi
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mnlipp/jgrapes-osgi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mnlipp/jgrapes-osgi)

See the [project's home page](http://mnlipp.github.io/jgrapes/).

This repository comprises JGrapes components that are built on top of the 
[library components](https://github.com/mnlipp/jgrapes) 
and depend on the OSGi framework. They have been put in a seperate repository 
because they require a different top-level build approach than the libraries
that can be used as OSGi bundles but do not depend on the OSGi framework.
